                    <div class="extra-text">This interactive video aims to create an abstract and exploratory approach to questions revolving around the individual 
                        state of existence. The interactive element provides an experience in which agency is applied to this uncontrollable inevitability. 
                        There are light and dark environments intended to display surrealistic qualities that signal an altered state of existence.
                        The viewer is given the option to choose either light or dark. There are hints in both environments designed to inform the viewers choice. 
                        The viewer is then given the choice to enter one of three doors, which appear in a specific pair depending on the previous choice: door number one 
                        alludes to being stuck in the state of limbo or death, door number two alludes to entering an afterlife, and door number three signals a return back to life.</div>

                    <div class="extra-text"> A mannequin figure is used to symbolize the extent music can mold the listener to experience a sensation 
                        in which every note and vibration is absorbed into a personal and individualized moment in time. The act of listening to music alone can often evoke the sensation of isolation: this is expressed 
                        in the warped textures of the instruments. Listening to music can also make you feel as though the environment around you is changing. The moment the record plays, the piano spins as if it was the
                         record itself; the guitar strings appear in the middle of the circular piano creating a shape similar to that of an acoustic guitar. The mannequin is in the centre of its surroundings with the act of 
                         listening being represented as a colour change in alignment with the note being played. Once the music stops, the listener is left with only themselves. </div>

                    <div class="extra-text">The act of pressing play typically represents the intent to begin an experience, whether visual or auditory. 
                        The journey could be familiar or completely new. A walking cassette character acts as the subject of a journey in which adversity is at play. 
                        Reaching the end goal of repair of the self is often met with challenges such as the reversal of progress and getting cut short. The idea of tunnel vision is represented 
                        through the building along the way: they have random symbols and letters signifying the unknown barriers encountered through one’s journey. 
                        The journey is not always successful; outside factors could interrupt the process just as the end seems near. You just need to press play again.  </div>

                    <div class="extra-text">This video follows the engagement with a simulation in which one aims to navigate a string of interruptions that intrude on one’s isolated experience. 
                        Often times a break is needed from the auditory experience. Instead, one might choose to alter their auditory experience by isolating themselves in a “bubble” of their chosen form of listening. 
                        Smaller bubbles as well as wrong notes, although some say there is no wrong notes in jazz, are used to symbolize the deconstruction of the musical theme; thus, a temporary disruption of the isolated experience. 
                        These interruptions represent the notion that one cannot fully escape from the pollution of everyday noise. 
                        The paused states in between each scene provide a moment of reflection to the listener. The final question is intended to examine if one is not only visually interpreting their experience, but auditorily as well.  </div>
